# Penetration_testing_automation
This is a penetration testing using OSWAP ZAP
In this read me file I will mention what details I'm using for this project:
OWASP ZAP automation using java, selenium, zapClient, TestNG and Maven

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy is a free security tool which acts as a proxy between browser and network, find security issues in web applications & report them to the end user.

ZAP by default passively scans all HTTP messages (requests and responses) sent to the web application being tested. Passive scanning does not change the HTTP messages. Active scanning attempts to find potential issues by using known attacks against the selected targets. Active scanning is an attack on those targets.

Penetration testing can never be done without taking permission from the owner of the web apps.

Tools used:- IntelliJ, Java, Maven, TestNG

dependencies:-

TestNG-https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng/6.11

Selenium-https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java/4.7.2

zapClient- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.zaproxy/zap-clientapi/1.11.0

WebDriverManager - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/5.3.1

Demo Steps:
Step 1:- download the owasp zap zip file from-https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/releases/download/v2.11.1/ZAP_2.11.1_Crossplatform.zip & extract the content.

Step 2:-Run the bat file from extracted folder, once tool gets started-select first radio button and click on start. This is a prerequisite that this tool shall be kept open for scan to work. by default it will open on port-8080, http://127.0.0.1:8080

Step 3:-Naviagte to tools-Options-API, note the api key.

Step 4:-Create a new maven java project in IDE.

Step 5:- Add following dependencies in pom.xml-testng, zap-clientapi, selenium, webdrivermanager

Step 6:- Create a project where we will do following things:- - Define owasp zap as a proxy,driver setup, using proxy in driver & initializing ClientAPI reference. - Open url on which scan needs to be performed, wait for passive scan to completed - Generate scan report and close browser window.

scan url-http://127.0.0.1:8080/ Or go through https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/, please read the usage policies before using it for passive scan. Active scan though these sites might allow(please see in the policy) but on a safer side I will recommend to perfom on loclahost only.

ZAP API Reference with end points-https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/api/ ZAP API on local-http://127.0.0.1:8080/UI

Glimpse of upcoming topics that we will cover through automation-

Overview of the reporting capabilities.
Site tree-Adding a url, verifying the added urls, removing the urls from site tree.
Running an active scan and waiting till the scan is completed.
Running both passive and Active scan & creating separate reports for both.
Setting up postman for zap client end points.
Using Restassured as another approach for interacting with zapClient api.
